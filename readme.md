This is just pong, but the real purpose is to demonstrate the Networking module: it offers a very versatile, easy to 
use abstraction over raw udp sockets supporting LAN, WAN with NAT punching handled transparently, and mixes of
both. I haven't done any godot work in a while and I know the engine gets updated quite rapidly so this may not work
as is, but I think anyone familiar with the specific problems that roadblock a lot of designs trying to 
solve these issues (particularly in Godot) will likely find this a valuable launchpad. I intend to revisit it in the 
future- if/when I return to game dev and there is still no better solution out there.
